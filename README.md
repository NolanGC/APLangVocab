##Raw Paste Data Example

Allegory 
– The device of using character and/or story elements symbolically to represent an abstraction in addition to the literal meaning. In some allegories, for example, an author may intend the characters to personify an abstraction like hope or freedom. The allegorical meaning usually deals with moral truth or a generalization about human existence.

EX.: Animal Farm by George Orwell
Alliteration
The repetition of sounds, especially initial consonants or more neighboring words (as in “she sells sea shells). Although the term is not used frequently in the multiple-choice section, you can look for alliteration in any essay passage. The repetition can reinforce meaning, unify ideas, supply a musical sound, and/or echo the sense of the passage.

EX.: "The soul selects her own society." - Emily Dickinson
Allusion
A direct or indirect reference to something which is presumably commonly known, such as an event, book, myth, place, or work of art. Allusions can be historical, literary, religious, topical, or mythical. There are many more possibilities, and a work may simultaneously use multiple layers of allusion.

EX.: “Plan ahead: it wasn’t raining when Noah built the ark” - Richard Cushing
